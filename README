This is a simple framework and collection of servlets designed for use with http://github.com/Rybec/emacs-web-server.

This project is primarily written in literate elisp, in Emacs org files.


* Usage

Run make to generate .el files.

Start web server with something like the following:
emacs -Q -batch -l simple-httpd.el -l app.el -f httpd-batch-start

simple-httpd.el can be found in http://github.com/Rybec/emacs-web-server

* Todo

Have the makefile generate .elc files from the .el files.

Add some sample servlets.

Add more tag generators to html.org.
